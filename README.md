# TASK-SYTYCR
So You Think You Can Research

In this task, you will build a project that does NOT use a framework, so you can't use Express or React. The purpose of this project is to use new libraries and technologies and learn how to use them through reading the documentation.

Here is a list of features you can add to your project:

- Public APIs
- Send emails (SendGrid)
- Web scraping
- Read from a file (word/excel/csv)
- Discord bot
- Send SMS (Twilio)

Example:
I built a Discord bot that fetches today's weather. So I had to learn how to build a Discord bot and how to get the weather using a public API.
